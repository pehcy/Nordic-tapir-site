# Humble Introduction

First off, thank you for taking time to read this article. I’m writing here not just to summarize my notes and findings, but also to enhance my technical writing skill and sharing what I’ve learned during these few weeks.

A few weeks ago I established an informal research on algorithmic trading and time series data, I decide to start building a [crypto trading bot](https://github.com/pehcy/binoculars) that would retrieve the candlesticks data for every minutes. First I had established the socket connection to Binance Streamer and retrieve real time data successfully, I then continue to build a mathematical algorithm to analyze the movement of k-lines.
